\section{Implementing the {\tt WHILE} Language} 
\label{sec:implementingWhile}
\lineofthought{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Haskell: good support for parsing ({\tt Parsec}) and clean case 
			definitions (deconstruction by contructor).
		\item Pure language, need for a ``pipeline'' (Monad) to process stateful
			language ($\rightarrow$ monad transformers, made it easy to add 
			function calls (environment, i.e. {\tt ReaderT}))
		\item made tracking of execution hard though: writer monad with a record
			monoid. Make a monoid transformer maybe to get flexible addition of new 
			information.
		\item Strict typing made it easier to catch cases, where I had 
			unevaluated expressions ({\tt DataExpression}) vs evaluated data ({\tt Tree} type)
	\end{itemize}

\section{My general notes}
\lineofthought{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Parallel text to B\&K
		\item Exercises ~2 per chapter
		\item Summaries of "known topics"
		\item Michael Sipser: {\em Introduction to the Theory of Computation} 
			standard text.
		\item Intrinsic complexity (defining languages that capture complexity 
			classes)
	\end{itemize}
