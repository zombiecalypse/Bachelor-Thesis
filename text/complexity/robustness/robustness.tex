\section{Robustness of time complexity}
\lineofthought{
	Here I'd show that realistic formalisms are $P$-reducable to each other, 
	which corresponds to the equivalence of e.g. \TM and \WHILE\@. Beyond these 
	two, I'd have to introduce the formalisms, which might not be helpful. The 
	constructions from the proofs should actually be efficient enough (maximum 
	quadratic slowdown).
