\subsection{The Elements} % (fold)
\label{sub:TheElements}
The \FOR language contains only very basic commands, but they can be combined
to implement a huge number of algorithms. As the data structure, we choose 
the humble $ConsCell$, that contains only a reference as the head and 
another as the tail\footnote{An observant reader will notice that this
structure stems from the building of linked lists.}. Because the head and the tail point to \emph{something}, we also need some 
atomic data, that it can point to. We introduce $Nil$, which points at 
nothing and is the basis for the $ConsCell$ data. As a short cut notation, let 
\[[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] := ConsCell(a_1, ConsCell(a_2, \dots ConsCell(a_n, Nil)\dots )).\]

\end{figure}

To make the programs easier to decipher, we also use named symbols, which are
not strictly necessary: we could also use lists to code them.

The formal definitions of the semantics of \FOR can be seen in the tables 
\ref{tab:for-sem-exp} and \ref{tab:for-sem-stat}, but to gain familiarity 
with semantic functions, the following sections will explain the meaning of 
the definitions.

In the \FOR language, when we write the expression $\mathtt{cons}\: e_1\: e_2$, it
will give us such a $ConsCell$ with the evaluation of $e_1$ in the head and the
evaluation of $e_2$ in the tail. The expression $\mathtt{hd}\: e$ yields the head of
the evaluation of $e$ and $\mathtt{tl}\: e$ its tail. The expression 
$\mathtt{nil}$ just gives back $Nil$\footnote{
	Note the difference: $\mathtt{nil}$ is an expression in the language,
	literally the string {\tt nil}, but $Nil $ is the mathematical entity.
	Similarly you should not mix up $\mathtt{cons}\: a\: b$ and $ConsCell(x, y)$}.
We also want to refer to stored values, so an identifier (e.g. {\tt X}) can
also be an expression, the evaluation of which depends on the current variable
bindings.

There are very few types of statements in \FOR, just three to be precise: The 
first is the \emph{assignment} $\mathtt{X}\:\mathtt{:=}\: e$, which assigns the variable {\tt X}
the evaluation of $e$. Later, when {\tt X} is used in an expression, it 
will reproduce this value. The second is the classic {\tt if} statement, that 
only executes its first block, if the expression does \emph{not} return {\tt nil} 
and the else-block -- if any -- otherwise. Finally, there is the eponymous 
$\mathtt{for}\: I\: \mathtt{in}\: e\: block$ loop, that works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item On first entering the loop, the expression $e$ is evaluated and stored.
	\item If the evaluation is $Nil$, we are done.
	\item Otherwise the block is evaluated with the head of $e$ bound to the 
		variable name $I$.
	\item Then this procedure is run again with the tail of $e$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}
	If $c = \{(name_i, value_i)\}$ is the variable binding at the time of the evaluation:
	\begin{align}
			\interpret{\mathtt{nil}}(c) &= Nil \\
			\interpret{\mathtt{:}a}(c) &= symbol_a\\
			\interpret{\mathtt{cons}\: A\: B}(c)=\interpret{\mathtt{(}A\mathtt{.}B\mathtt{)}} &=  ConsCell(\interpret{A}(c), \interpret{B}(c)) \\
			\interpret{\mathtt{hd}\: A}(c) &= \begin{cases}
				x, &\text{ if }\interpret{A}(c) = ConsCell(x, y)\\

\subsection{Coding \FOR programs}
\label{sub:code-for}
Some of the more interesting programs in the \FOR language use other \FOR programs 
as their input, for example a program $composition$ that takes a program $p$ and another program $q$, such that $\interpret{\interpret{composition}(p, q)}(x) = \interpret{p}(\interpret{q}(x))$. In order to create such a program, we need some interpretation \lineofthought{This would be a good point to start talking of functors, but then again, nobody wants to hear that in a practical text} $\coded{.}: \FOR \rightarrow \Input[\FOR]$.

One possible way to go about this is interpreting blocks and expressions as lists and denote them:
\begin{table}
\begin{align*}
	\coded{\mathtt{nil}} &= symbol_{nilexp}\\
	\coded{\mathtt{:}a} &= [symbol_{symbol}, symbol_a] \\
	\coded{\mathtt{cons\: a\: b }} &= [symbol_{cons}, \coded{a}, \coded{b}]\\
	\coded{\mathtt{hd}\: a} &= [symbol_{hd}, \coded{a}]\\
	\coded{\mathtt{tl}\: a} &= [symbol_{tl}, \coded{a}]\\
	\coded{variable} &= [symbol_{var}, symbol_{variable}] \\
	\coded{a\: \mathtt{:=}\: e} &= [symbol_{assign}, symbol_a, \coded{e}]\\
	\coded{\mathtt{\{ } b_1 \mathtt{;} b_2 \mathtt{;} \dots \mathtt{;} b_n \mathtt{\} }} &= [\coded{b_1}, \coded{b_2}, \dots, \coded{b_n}]\\
	\coded{\mathtt{for}\: a\: \mathtt{in}\: e\: block} &= [symbol_{for}, symbol_a, \coded{e}, \coded{block}]\\
	\coded{\mathtt{if}\: e\: if\mhyphen block\: else\mhyphen block} &= [symbol_{if}, \coded{e}, \coded{if\mhyphen block}, \coded{else\mhyphen block}]
\end{align*}
\caption{Coding the \FOR language in its own data}
\end{table} 
\subsection{\FOR computability}
The probably most important property of the \FOR language is that programs in 
it always terminate. The reason for this is, that upon entering the for loop, 
the number of repetitions is fixed as the length of the evaluated expression. 
Since we can't build an infinite expression in the finite time before the 
loop, the program terminates.

When experimenting with the language, one quickly finds, that many important 
functions are \FOR computable:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Constant functions.
	\item Addition.
	\item Multiplication -- as repeated addition.
	\item Exponentiation -- as repeated multiplication.
	\item Unary/binary conversion.
	\item Testing if a given number is prime.
	\item ...
\end{itemize}

As we can see, it is relatively simple to generate huge numbers using the 
\FOR language and then generate lists with that length.

At first glance it seems that any computation can be defined this way, but 
sadly, that is not the case.

Intuitively the interpretation of a \FOR program should be computable. We can 
do it in an algorithmic way and so it is only reasonable to expect \FOR to be 
able to interpret itself. As we will see, that can not be the case:

\begin{theorem}
	There is no \FOR program $exec$ that takes $ConsCell(program, input)$ as its 
	argument and returns $\interpret{program}(input)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume, there was a procedure in \FOR $exec$ that takes $(program.input)$ as 
its argument. Now the following procedure would surely be a \FOR program too:

\begin{verbatim}
inverse read X {
  result := [exec](X.X)
  if result {
    Y := FALSE;
  } else {
    Y := TRUE;
  }
} write Y
\end{verbatim}

We have 
\[ \interpret{inverse}(program) = \begin{cases}
		\mathtt{TRUE}, &\text{ if }\interpret{program}(program) = \mathtt{FALSE} \\
		\mathtt{FALSE}, &\text{ otherwise }
	\end{cases} \]

It outputs {\tt TRUE} iff the given program outputs {\tt FALSE}. What then 
is \sloppy$\interpret{inverse}(inverse)$ ? Assume first that it is 
{\tt TRUE}, then by definition it is {\tt FALSE} -- and vice versa! So it 
neither returns {\tt TRUE} \emph{nor} {\tt FALSE}. The only way that would 
work would be if it didn't return anything at all, but as we have seen, all 
\FOR programs terminate in finite time, so that can not be the case. 
Therefore {\tt inverse} can not be a \FOR program and by extension {\tt exec} 
is not a \FOR program. 
\footnote{This is the quitessential uncomputability 
	proof: A coding of the function is given that can be evaluated, but running 
  the program on itself leads to complications.}
\end{proof}

This is unfortunate, not only because we have seen that there are functions 
that are not \FOR computable, but that in general, any language that supports 
the building blocks of {\tt inverse} either doesn't support 
self-interpretation or it contains programs that will not halt.

As we try to capture \emph{all} intuitively computable functions, it is not 
acceptable to leave self-interpretation out, so in the next chapter, we will 
explore a language that will contain non-halting programs.

\subsection{The \FOR in real programming languages}
It turns out, that while the {\tt for} keyword exists in most languages in 
one form or another, few acurately model the \FOR languages intention. 
Foremost most languages cheat around the property of \FOR loops always 
terminating: In C-like languages, the loop variable is not immutable and therefore
\begin{verbatim}
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	  // ...
	}
\end{verbatim}
might very well not terminate, if {\tt i} is decremented in the body. 
Iterator-based loops can be tricked by implementing an iterator that does not 
halt, i.e. produces a new value on any {\tt next}.

\subsection{The \FOR in mathematics and logic}
The \FOR computable functions match a category of functions known as 
\emph{primitive recursive}. A function is \emph{primitive recursive}, if it is either
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A successor function $S_i(x_1,\dots,x_n) = x_i+1$
	\item A projection function $P_i(x_1,\dots,x_n) = x_i$
	\item In the form of primitive recursion:
		\begin{equation*}
			f(n,x_1,\dots,x_n) = \begin{cases}
				g(x_1,\dots,x_n), &\text{ if }n=0\\
				h(f(n-1, x_1, \dots, x_n), x_1,\dots,x_n),&\text{ else}
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation*}
		Where $g$ and $h$ are primitive recursive.
\end{enumerate}
It is easy to see that \FOR can compute any primitive recursive function:
The successor function and the projections are trivial, for the primitive 
recursion, we have programs $\interpret{G}=g$ and $\interpret{H}=h$ by 
induction assumption. 

\begin{verbatim}
F read NX {
  N := hd NX
  Xs := tl NX
  Repetitions := [unary](N)
  Result := [G](Xs)
  Counter := 0
  for I in Repetitions {
    Result := [H](Result.Xs)
  }
} write Result
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Exercise}[title={\FOR computable functions are primitive recursive}]
	\Question Can you model an {\tt if} statement in primitive recursion?
	\Question How would you implement a {\tt for} loop with primitive recursion?
	\Question How could we model assignment in the primitive recursive functions?
	\Question \emph{Difficult:} Show that $ConsCell$ can be modelled in the 
		natural numbers, with primitive recursive functions handling $\mathtt{cons}$, 
		$\mathtt{hd}$ and $\mathtt{tl}$.
