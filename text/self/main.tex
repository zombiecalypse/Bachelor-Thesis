\section{Self Interpretation\timeestimation{15h}}
\label{sec:self}
Self interpretation is the ability of an formalism to support an
"universal mechanism", that is a program that can interpret a finite
description of any programs in itself and apply it to some input.

For computability, self interpretation can be seen as some kind of gold
standard\citationneeded. This stems from the fact, that a simpler model of
computation, primitive recursive functions, are not self interpreting.
\lineofthought{How important {\em is} self-interpretation? 
Self-interpretation is a very fast way to turing completeness, since once
universality is an operation, all programming constructs are then mere
transformation of data. See also Kleene's Partial Recursive Functions.}
