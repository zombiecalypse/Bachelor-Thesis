The field of computability and complexity was, where computer science sprung 
from. Turing, Church, and Kleene all developed formalisms that demonstrated 
what they held "intuitively computable". The times change however and today's 
(aspiring) computer scientists are less proficient in building automata or 
composing functions and are much more native to the world of programming 
languages. This article will try to introduce typical concepts of 
computability theory and complexity in a form more fitted for a modern developer.
It is mostly based on \cite{jones}, but takes input from other sources to 
provide examples, additional information, etc.
