# Installation

The easiest way to install the while interpreter is to have [`easy_install`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) installed. In that case, you can just type

    $ sudo easy_install PyWhile

into your console.

Otherwise get yourself a [Python 2](http://python.org/) installation for your system.  Then go to the [PyWhile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyWhile) page and download the current version. Extract the archive somewhere and check that

    $ python path/to/PyWhile/bin/while.py -h

works and gives you a description of the options.
